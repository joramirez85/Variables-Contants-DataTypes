// - Variables and Constants are essentially containers for data
// -- With Variables, you can change the value that's contained
// -- With Constants you can only assign a value once
// -- Both have a data type associated with them

// Example of variable
// Use camel case convention  to name variables
var myAge : Int = 32

// Please check to the right. The value is printing and updating in real time ---->
myAge = 33

print(myAge)

//Example of Constants
let myName : String = "Omar"

// If you try to update a Constant you will get an error. Uncomment the next line to check.
// myName = "Jesús"

// Also you can open a bug console to check prints or errors. At the bottom select the first icon

let myAgeInTenYears = myAge + 10

// Concatenate strings
let myFullName = myName + " Ramírez"

// Another way
let myFullName2 = "\(myName) Ramírez"

// Using another constant for LastName
let myLastName : String = "Ramírez"

let myFullName3 = "\(myName) \(myLastName)"

let myDetails = "\(myName), \(myAge)"
